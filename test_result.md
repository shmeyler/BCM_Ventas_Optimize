# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Tested the new geographic API endpoints. The GET /api/geographic/states and GET /api/geographic/dmas endpoints are working correctly, returning mock data in the expected format. However, the GET /api/geographic/zip/{zip_code} and GET /api/geographic/zips endpoints are not working correctly. They are trying to fetch data from the DataUSA.io API, but the API is not returning any data for the ZIP codes tested (10001, 90210). This could be due to issues with the DataUSA.io API or changes in their API format. The implementation of the endpoints is correct, but the external API integration is not working."

    message: "Successfully tested the Census Bureau API integration for ZIP code data. Fixed an issue with loading environment variables by adding dotenv support to the server.py file. Tested the specific ZIP codes requested: 06877 (Ridgefield, CT), 94920 (Tiburon, CA), and 10001 (New York, NY). All ZIP codes now return real demographic data from the Census Bureau API with the correct source 'US_CENSUS_BUREAU'. The 06877 ZIP code correctly shows Connecticut, not Massachusetts. Both the single ZIP code endpoint (/api/geographic/zip/{zip_code}) and the multiple ZIP codes endpoint (/api/geographic/zips) are now working correctly."

    message: "Verified that the ZIP code city names are now correct after the fix with the Zippopotam.us API integration. Successfully tested the specific ZIP codes mentioned: 06854 now correctly shows as 'Norwalk, CT (06854)' instead of 'Ridgefield, CT', 06877 correctly shows as 'Ridgefield, CT (06877)', and 94920 correctly shows as 'Belvedere Tiburon, CA (94920)'. For each ZIP code, real demographic data is displayed including population, median income, median age, and property value. The Test Design Recommendations also update with real calculated values when a ZIP code is selected as a test region. The Zippopotam.us API integration is working properly to provide accurate city names for ZIP codes."

    message: "I've completed testing of the geographic functionality. The tab switching between ZIP codes, DMAs, and States works properly. I was able to search for and find ZIP code 06854 (Norwalk, CT) with real demographic data. The New York DMA (501) was also found successfully with demographic data. For states, I found New York with demographic data. Test Design Recommendations update with real calculated values when regions are selected. There are some console errors related to Census API calls, but they don't affect the core functionality. All three region types work with real data, and the ZIP codes tab switching issue is resolved."

    message: "Successfully tested the state search functionality that was fixed. The search for 'Maine' now works correctly, finding and displaying Maine with real Census Bureau demographic data (population: 1,366,949, median income: $68,251, median age: 44.8, unemployment: 4.0%). I also tested searching for other states including 'California', 'Texas', and 'New York', all of which were found successfully with their respective demographic data. When selecting Maine as a test region, the Test Design Recommendations section updates with statistical power calculations. There are some non-critical console errors related to React key warnings, but they don't affect the core functionality. The state search functionality is now working properly as requested."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the BCM VentasAI Optimize lift testing workflow. Successfully tested all phases of the workflow: 1) Geographic Region Selection - Added ZIP codes 06854 (Norwalk, CT) and 06877 (Ridgefield, CT), state 'California', and DMA 'New York' with real demographic data. 2) Lift Test Configuration - Created a test named 'Q2 2025 Connecticut Geo Lift Test' with Meta platform, Brand Lift test type, start/end dates, and $75,000 budget. 3) Test Management Dashboard - Verified test details view with configuration display, demographic data, power analysis (95% statistical power, 2.0% minimum detectable effect), and action buttons. 4) Meta Campaign Integration - The 'Launch Test Campaign' button is present but the Meta integration modal did not open as expected. 5) Platform Overview - Successfully navigated through created tests list with multiple tests visible. The core workflow functions properly with real Census data and Nielsen DMAs, though there are some console errors related to DMA API calls (404 responses for some DMA endpoints). Overall, the main lift testing workflow is functional with only minor issues in the Meta campaign integration."

    message: "Completed testing of the enhanced BCM VentasAI Optimize backend with the 5-step workflow for geo-incrementality testing. Most of the new endpoints are working correctly, but there are some issues with error handling in a few endpoints. The Objectives API and Budget API endpoints are working correctly, providing proper validation and recommendations. The Market Selection API has issues with error handling in the auto-select and similarity-analysis endpoints, which return 500 errors instead of 400 errors for invalid inputs. The Statistical Analysis API endpoints are working correctly, providing proper optimization, power analysis, and quality validation. The Enhanced Test Management API has an issue with the create-test endpoint, which returns a 422 error instead of a 400 error for invalid inputs. The legacy ZIP lookup endpoint also has an error handling issue. These issues should be fixed to ensure proper error handling throughout the API."
